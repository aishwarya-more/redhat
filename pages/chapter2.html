				<h1>What is Vim?</h1>
				<br>
				<p>Vim is just a simple text editor. It is similar to other text editors such as sublime text, notepad etc. Vim is also called as programmers editor. As it is a command line editor it does not have any GUI because of which it is faster and efficient to use. There are various other command line editor like nano, pico, Emacs etc. You can try and use any one of them. We will be using vim in all of our tutorials.</p>	

				<p>In order to check whether vim is installed on your machine or not type the following command in your terminal.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="commands jumbotron">$ vim </p>	
				<br>
				<p>If it is already installed on your machine you can see the version number. In case if it is not installed you will see an something like this <span style="font-family: 'Source Code Pro'">vim: command not found</span>. In order to install vim type following command and hit enter.</p>
				
				<br>
				<p class="commands jumbotron">$ sudo dnf install vim</p>
				<b>Note:</b> If you are using RHEL(Red Hat Enterprise Linux) replace the above command with sudo yum install vim.
				
				<br><br>
				<p>After successfully installing vim on your machine now is the time to explore it. Vim is a really powerfull editor. Once you get to know all the shortcuts/commands it will be really fast and easy to use it. Now, type the following command(without quotes) to open an existing file or create a new file.</p>
				
				<br>
				<p class="commands jumbotron">$ vim "filename"</p>
				<br>

				<p>You will see a complete black screen if it's a new file otherwise you will be able to see the contents. Vim editor consists of different modes namely <b>normal mode, insert mode, command mode and replace mode</b>. To find out more visit <a href="https://guide.freecodecamp.org/vim/modes/" target="0">Vim Modes</a>.</p>

				<br>
				<h1>Basic file operations in vim</h1>

	  				<li><p><b>Copy and Paste multiple lines:</b> Move the cursor at the beginning of the first line from which you want to copy and press <b>yy+(no. of lines). For eg: yy+10</b> here 10 is the number of lines which you want to copy.</p></li>
	  				<li><p><b>Copy and Paste a paragraph:</b> Move the cursor at the beginning of the paragraph and press <b>'y+Shift+{'</b> and press <b>'y+Shift+}'</b>.</p></li>
